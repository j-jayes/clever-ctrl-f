# Clever `CTRL+F`

Finding the right page of a PDF document when you're looking for a specific piece of information involves a lot of searching through pages.

What if we could use text embeddings to represent each page of the document as a vector, and find the most similar part of the document to the search term that we seek?

### Project Specification

#### 1. **PDF Document Processing**

- **Objective**: Convert PDF documents into a processable text format.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Python libraries like `PyPDF2`, `PDFMiner`, or `pdfplumber`.
- **Steps**:
  - Extract text from PDFs while preserving as much of the original formatting as possible.
  - Handle various types of PDFs (scanned, text-based, etc.).
  - Deal with challenges like multi-column layouts or embedded images.

#### 2. **Text Preprocessing and Tokenization**

- **Objective**: Prepare the extracted text for NLP tasks.
- **Tools/Libraries**: NLP libraries like `NLTK`, `spaCy`.
- **Steps**:
  - Normalize the text (lowercasing, removing special characters, etc.).
  - Tokenize the text into sentences or words.
  - Optionally, remove stop words or perform stemming/lemmatization.

#### 3. **Sentence Embedding Generation**

- **Objective**: Convert chunks of text into vector representations.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Sentence embedding models like BERT, GPT, Universal Sentence Encoder.
- **Steps**:
  - Chunk the text into segments (e.g., 200 tokens each).
  - Use a pre-trained model to generate embeddings for these chunks.

#### 4. **Embedding Search Terms**

- **Objective**: Convert search terms into the same vector space as the document embeddings.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Same as used for sentence embeddings.
- **Steps**:
  - Process the search terms with the same embedding model.
  - Ensure that the vector space is compatible with the document embeddings.

#### 5. **Similarity Matching**

- **Objective**: Find the most similar parts of the document for each search term.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Faiss, or similar libraries for efficient similarity search.
- **Steps**:
  - Calculate similarity scores between search term embeddings and document chunk embeddings.
  - Identify the chunks with the highest similarity scores for each term.

#### 6. **Highlighting Text in PDFs**

- **Objective**: Visually highlight the identified similar parts in the original PDFs.
- **Tools/Libraries**: PDF manipulation libraries like `PyMuPDF` (fitz), `reportlab`.
- **Steps**:
  - Map the identified text chunks back to their corresponding locations in the PDF.
  - Use PDF manipulation tools to highlight these areas.

#### 7. **User Interface**

- **Objective**: Display the annotated PDFs to the user.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Web framework (e.g., Flask, Django) for web interface; Desktop GUI (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt) for a desktop application.
- **Steps**:
  - Create a simple interface where users can upload PDFs and enter search terms.
  - Display the PDF with highlighted sections.
  - Optionally, provide options to download or further interact with the highlighted PDFs.

### Strategy for Implementation

1. **Prototype Development**: Begin with a simple prototype focusing on one PDF and a single search term. This will help in validating each step of the process.
2. **Incremental Development**: Once the prototype works, gradually add more features, such as handling multiple PDFs, multiple search terms, and improving the UI.
3. **Testing and Optimization**: Test with various PDF types and refine the process for better accuracy and efficiency. Consider optimizing the embedding and similarity search steps for speed and resource usage.
4. **Deployment**: Plan for deployment based on the intended use (web service, desktop application, etc.). Ensure scalability and security if deploying as a web service.
5. **Documentation and Maintenance**: Document the codebase and provide user manuals. Set up a maintenance plan for dealing with issues or updates.
